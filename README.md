In this lab, I created a machine learning model for the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic. I utilised various types of columns for this, which I've included below.

Specifics (Important columns)
=> diagnosis. The results. A two-level component that indicates whether a mass is malignant ("M") or benign ("B").
=> x. The forecasters. A matrix containing the mean, standard deviation, and worst value of each of the ten nuclear measures on the slide, for a total of 30 characteristics per biopsy:
=> radius. Nucleus radius (average distance from the centre to points on the perimeter).
=> texture. Texture of the nucleus (standard deviation of grayscale values).
=> perimeter. The circumference of the nucleus.
=> area. The nucleus.
=> smoothness. Smoothness of the nucleus (local fluctuation in radius lengths).
=> compactness. Nucleus compactness (area/perimeter - 1).
=> concavity, Concavity of the nucleus (the severity of the contour's concave parts).
=> concave_pts. The number of concave nucleus contour parts.
=> symmetry. Symmetry of the nucleus.
=> fractal_dim. fractal diameter of the nucleus ("coastline approximation" -1).

According to the Breast Cancer Classification Model Evaluation, the model had a 92.98% accuracy. This demonstrates that the model is highly accurate at classifying breast cancer cases.
With a high accuracy score of 92.98%, the model is capable of distinguishing between benign and malignant breast cancer cases. This is an excellent result because it demonstrates the model's capacity to assist in accurate diagnosis.
